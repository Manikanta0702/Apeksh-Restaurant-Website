        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p>Our mission is to empower individuals with hearing and speech impairments by providing them with employment
            opportunities in a supportive and inclusive environment.</p>

            <h2>Problems Faced by Disabled People</h2>
            <p>People with disability also face barriers, stigmatization, and discrimination when accessing health and
                health-related services and strategies. Disability is a development priority because of its higher
                prevalence in lower-income countries and because disability and poverty reinforce and perpetuate one
                another.</p>
            <p>Vision loss can affect your physical health by increasing your risk of falls and your quality of life,
                and it can also have a big impact on your mental health. Loss of vision has been linked to loneliness,
                social isolation, and feelings of worry, anxiety, and fear. Depression is common in people with vision
                loss.</p>
            <p>Communication is the only medium by which we can share our thoughts or convey the message but for a
                person with a disability (deaf and dumb) faces difficulty in communication with a normal person. Because
                of this, a person who lacks in hearing and speaking ability is not able to stand in race with a normal
                person.</p>
            <p>Difficulty With Transportation: Most people who have disabilities do not have a car, so they must rely on
                public transportation, which can be difficult for them to navigate. Even getting to a job interview can
                be tough.</p>
            <p>Lack of education: Less than 20 percent have a college degree. In fact, fewer people with disabilities
                graduate from high school than those who do not have disabilities.</p>

            <h2>Solution</h2>
            <p>Our main solution is to have a restaurant with the unique feature that the employees are mute as in dumb
                and deaf. We communicate to customers with a special menu which consists of sign language to
                communicate.</p>
            <p>The name of our restaurant is APEKSH, which means hope in Sanskrit. Anyhow the statistics show that
                employers' concerns are off base. People with disabilities who are already in the workforce have proven
                themselves to be very reliable, to take fewer sick days than the general population, and have high job
                retention (staying at their jobs).</p>
            <p>People with disabilities also have better safety records. They have fewer job-related accidents, possibly
                because they already know their limitations and what they can and cannot risk.</p>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>In this idea, we conclude that the main aim is we are trying to get employment for disabled people. A
                friendly restaurant that will help them stand on their own feet. Make them feel connected in the world
                and also it will help them boost their self-confidence and help them find their true self.</p>
            <p>We rise to great heights by winding staircase of small steps and we call it Apeksh. The three main rules
                of Apeksh are “EAT, EXPLORE, AND ENJOY”.</p>
